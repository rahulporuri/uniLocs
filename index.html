      <p >
        I was a science student and I went through one season of grad school applications. Specifically, 
        I was interested in Astronomy & Astrophysics. The process of finalizing grad schools to 
        apply to was taxing, to say the least. And while there were numerous lists that contained links to 
        grad schools, primarily in the USA, most of the links were outdated and broken. And a map is, to me, 
        the best way to visualize the locations of various universities.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        There are still a lot of things to do, namely -
        <ul>
          <li> Clean up the map to make it more visually <i>pleasing</i>
          <li> Increase the size of the markers for ease of access and 
                convert all markers to be of the same color. Maybe colors 
                labs/research center differently from universities.
          <li> Remove (Lat, Long) information from the hover-over box, 
                convert the web links into hyper links, add the university name, 
                add admission deadline information.
          <li> Add more universities to the list/map. 
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p> The interactive plots were made using <a href="https://plot.ly/">plot.ly</a>. 
            After obtaining the addresses of the universities/labs, I converted them to (Lat, Long)
            <a href="http://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html">using this website</a>.
            I wrote two blogposts, containing initial versions of the interactive maps, that can be 
            found <a href="http://rahulporuri.blogspot.in/2016/03/visualizing-locations-of-astronomical_19.html">here</a> 
            and <a href="rahulporuri.blogspot.com/2016/03/visualizing-locations-of-astronomical.html">here</a>. 
            The datafile is available in a .csv format
            <a href="https://github.com/rahulporuri/uniLocs/blob/master/uni%20locations%20-%20Sheet1.csv">here</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        And as I always say, any and every comment is welcome and highly appreciated.
        And if you're really interested, open an issue on something you want changed, something 
        you think is missing or something that you think will be a good addition
